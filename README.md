# Martinis-page
<!-- Need to work on my page responsiveness.  Loved working with Tailwind, Chatgpt and codepen to create a fun webpage.  Would like to work on video uploads using iframes like what Sina had.  As my video page sadly didn't work out.  Am having a lot of problems pushing to git, not sure whether it's the file sizes or my very old mac. -->
